      "content": "Colombo, Dec.5 (Daily Mirror) - With as many as 449 wild elephants and 169 people getting killed in the human-elephant conflict by December 1, this year, the relevant authorities are still at a loss to work out a practical solution to the problem. According to the latest statistics released by the Department of Wildlife Conservation, gunshot injuries have claimed the lives of 81 pachyderms. Besides, 60 jumbos perished due to electrocution. Hakka Patas (jaw bombs or explosive-laden baits) killed 44 elephants, train accidents 22, poisoning four, road accidents one and other forms of accidents 14. Four elephants drowned after falling into agro-wells. The wildlife authorities cannot vouch for the reason for the remainder of elephant deaths because carcasses have been decomposed by the time of discoveries. The human-elephant conflict is not a phenomenon that occurred in recent times. It has been going on for decades, but the intensity of the problems has increased by leaps and bounds due to enhanced encounters between people and elephants. A 2019 study says that people live in nearly 70 per cent of the elephant range in Sri Lanka. It means people encounter elephants more frequently. The problem is severely found in the Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Eastern Forest Ranges. With the latest statistics, this year appears to be the worst in terms of the number of deaths on both sides. People expand further into wild space for agricultural activities, resulting in herds of elephants marauding croplands at the end. Nutritious crops like maize, rice and bananas are enticing for gentle giants. Farmers are used to install electric fences, but the solution has not yet been effective. Then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa formed a high-level committee consisting of experts from different fields who came up with a National Action Plan. This committee was headed by elephant biologist Prithiviraj Fernando of the Centre for Conservation and Research (CCRSL), and submitted its report in December 2020. Current President Ranil Wickremesinghe, has recently directed authorities to enact the action plan, in line with the elephant conservation policy adopted in 2006. An action plan is needed. In most regional countries afflicted with the human–elephant conflict, farmers use common tactics to drive away wild elephants from their lands, according to affected farmers. According to the International Fund for Animal Welfare, elephants are mega-herbivores that eat up to 150 kilograms of forage and drink up to 190 litres of water a day. It says they must navigate across large areas to find enough food and water to survive. But, the land is shrinking, making co-existence harder. An action plan has to be evolved with practical approaches, as otherwise both humans and elephants will continue to perish.",

Economists in a Reuters poll had forecast annual inflation of 4.3% in November, within the central bank’s 4.0 to 4.8% projection for the month. November inflation, which was at the lowest level since March 2022, brought the year-to-date average inflation to 6.2 %, still outside the central bank’s 2%-4% target for the year. Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, was at 4.7% in November versus 5.3% the previous month. Last month’s slower inflation could ease pressure on the central bank to keep interest rates higher for longer. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas kept interest rates steady at 6.5% at its meeting in November, after an off-cycle 25-basis point hike on Oct. 26 amid worries of inflation spiraling out of control.

      "content": "CRAIG BROWN: Question - How many Tory MPs fit in a VW Polo? Answer - all of them... if next year's news actually comes true By Craig Brown for the Daily Mail Published: 20:21 EST, 4 December 2023 | Updated: 20:22 EST, 4 December 2023 e-mail View comments January Following complaints that his film Napoleon contains startling historical errors, British director Ridley Scott is now filming Churchill, starring Tom Cruise in the title role, with Scarlett Johansson as his wife Clemmie. The film ends with Winston Churchill and his arch-enemy Adolf Hitler (Alan Cumming) grappling on the top of a fast-moving train as it hurtles through Colorado . British director Ridley Scott is now filming Churchill, starring Tom Cruise in the title role, with Scarlett Johansson as his wife Clemmie February BBC Radio 4’s long-running consumer programme, You And Yours, investigates the ongoing problem of hats. ‘We’ve heard terrible stories from listeners who’ve written in to complain that their hats are far too small to fit on their heads,’ reveals presenter Winifred Robinson. ‘And others from listeners who say their hats are much too big. ‘It all amounts to nothing less than a worldwide epidemic of hat-misery.’ A spokesman for the Hat Survivors League calls on the Government to put more investment into the care and protection of hat victims. ‘No one who hasn’t ever experienced a hat blowing off their head in a high wind will ever know what it feels like,’ he says. ‘And it’s up to all of us to show them that we care.’ March Netflix, Amazon and other streaming services have been forced to advertise for fresh serial killers. Streaming services including Netflix and Amazon are running out of serial killers for documentary series. Pictured: Serial killer nurse Lucy Letby ‘Our true crime supply has just about dried up,’ says TV executive Max Proffitt. ‘We’ve run major eight-part documentary series on every serial killer there’s ever been, and now we’re having to feature hobby killers who’ve only murdered one or two people. ‘In two or three years’ time, even they will have run out, and we’ll be having to produce full-length true crime series on a guy who once stole a bar of chocolate from his local store. That’s why we’re appealing for undiscovered serial killers to come forward. The rewards will be tremendous.’ April With the new series of The Crown under way, writer Peter Morgan reveals some exciting plot turns. ‘Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II in a skiing accident, the Duchess of Sussex flies from her home in Montecito to London Heathrow, hoping to seize control of the British throne. ‘But on her arrival at Buckingham Palace, she is shocked to find that Edward and Sophie have got there first and have chained themselves to the throne. ‘Luckily, the Duchess of York is on Meghan’s side and calls in a favour from the Keeper of the Privy Purse, Lord Richard Branson.’ Imelda Staunton as the late Queen Elizabeth II alongside Dominic West as Charles in The Crown To critics who suggest none of these incidents happened in real life, Morgan retorts: ‘Fact: Meghan lives in Montecito. Fact: Heathrow Airport is situated near London. Fact: there is a throne in Buckingham Palace. In some areas, I may have taken artistic licence, but my 100-strong team of researchers are right about all the essentials.’ May The Government plans a major crackdown against anyone caught without being in possession of a mobile phone. ‘For too long we have given free rein to those who think they can exist without a mobile phone,’ says hard-hitting Conservative MP Lee Anderson. ‘But enough is enough. From now on, police will be on the lookout for anyone on the streets or on public transport who is looking straight ahead and failing to keep their eyes glued to a mobile.’ June ‘There are cautious grounds for optimism,’ declares Tory chairman Ethelred King after the Conservatives lose all but three of their seats in the 2024 general election. ‘Frankly, this makes the parliamentary party much more streamlined, with far fewer disagreements. And it cuts down on the costs of transport and administration. ‘The whole party can fit into a VW Polo, with room for one extra. Things have never looked better.’ ‘There are cautious grounds for optimism,’ declares Tory chairman Ethelred King after the Conservatives lose all but three of their seats in the 2024 general election. Pictured: Gillian Keegan, Mark Harper and Steve Barclay Within hours of his party’s landslide election victory, Labour leader Keir Starmer faces calls for his resignation. ‘We were promised a revival of the fortunes of ordinary working people, but it’s been nearly two hours now and Keir’s done nothing,’ complains an irate Labour member. ‘He said he was all for change — but my car is exactly the same as it was yesterday, and so are my house and family,’ agrees a leading trades unionist. ‘These politicians always fail to deliver on their promises.’ Tom Cruise Scarlett Johansson Buckingham Palace Share or comment on this article: CRAIG BROWN: Question - How many Tory MPs fit in a VW Polo?

      "description": "Brittany Higgins has rejected suggestions by Bruce Lehrmann's lawyers she deleted texts from her phone that contradicted her allegation of sexual assault.",
      "content": "Text messages sent by Brittany Higgins about the time she was allegedly raped were accidentally deleted and were not erased as part of a deliberate strategy, a court has been told. Higgins returned to a witness box for a third day of questioning on Tuesday, and was grilled by Bruce Lehrmann’s legal team about missing messages from her phone. She admitted deleting one photograph of her in a Make America Great Again hat from her phone before she handed the device over to police during their investigation into the alleged sexual assault. “It was something I was really ashamed of and I deleted it,” Higgins told Justice Michael Lee. Lehrmann claims a February 2021 report by The Project on Higgins’ allegation of sexual assault destroyed his reputation, despite him not being named as the accused at the time. Higgins alleges she was raped by Lehrmann in the early hours of March 23, 2019, in the office of their then boss, Liberal senator Linda Reynolds. He has vehemently denied any sexual contact occurred. Lehrmann’s barrister Steven Whybrow SC claimed Higgins had done more than erase the single photo before handing her phone to police, pointing to a number of other messages later found missing from her phone. These included messages she had sent to two men she said she had matched with on dating apps at the time, and her former boyfriend and Parliament House colleague Ben Dillaway. Higgins denied deleting these messages intentionally because they would have contradicted her claims she was sexually assaulted. The messages had been lost when she changed devices over the years, moved to a different iCloud account, or had been accidentally deleted, the court heard. “I wasn’t thinking of maintaining contemporaneous evidence. It wasn’t in my mindset,” Higgins told the court. Lehrmann was charged in August 2021 over the alleged rape, but his criminal trial in the was derailed by juror misconduct. Prosecutors did not seek a second trial, citing concerns for Higgins’ mental health.",

      "content": "The Block's serial buyer Danny Wallis reveals why he is selling all his Melbourne properties as he blames Dan Andrews for the move READ MORE: Why Danny Wallis is forced to sell his incredible Melbourne pad for $3.5million By Mary Mrad For Daily Mail Australia Published: 20:21 EST, 4 December 2023 | Updated: 20:21 EST, 4 December 2023 e-mail View comments Infamous Block buyer Danny Wallis has revealed he will be selling all his properties in Victoria after former premier Dan Andrews introduced new property laws. Wallis told the Herald Sun he will be off-loading all his investment homes ahead of a land tax hike set for January 2024. Under the new regulations owners must pay land tax on secondary property's valued at $50,000 and over. The current threshold is $300,000. 'I'm saving on Daniel Andrew's land tax, I'm going to sell because I'm sick of the land tax going up and up and up,' he said. 'I'm going to move all my investments out of Victoria.' The Block's serial buyer Danny Wallis (pictured) has revealed why he's selling all his Melbourne properties Wallis said he is now planning to invest interstate and will sell his Victorian portfolio over the next two years. 'I know so many landlords who are selling because of the land tax,' he added. Wallis has spent more than $30million buying property during final auctions on The Block over the last few years. The high-profile businessman made headlines last year on Nine's hit renovation show when he won the bid on Omar and Oz's property. The controversial Blockheads Omar and Oz walked away with $1.6million after Wallis entered into a bidding war with their 'millionaire friend' which forced him to buy the home for $5.6million. Wallis later admitted he had 'spent too much' on the property, acknowledging the bidding war had just been a clash of egos. Wallis told the Herald Sun he'll be off-loading all his investment homes in Victoria after former premier Dan Andrews (pictured) introduced new property laws He previously purchased Mitch Edwards and Mark McKie's house for $4,044,444.44 in 2021. Wallis also snapped up Tanya and Vito Guccione's for $3,800,000.01, and Kirsty Lee Akers and Jesse Anderson's for $4,401,523.67 that same season. During the 2020 series, Danny also spent big and bought three apartments for just under $12million after purchasing properties in the 2016 and 2012 seasons. Despite the furore he excites at the auction each year, Danny is a philanthropist who gives away many of the homes he buys to children's cancer charities. He has donated multiple homes to the My Room Children's Cancer Charity and Ronald McDonald House for use by terminally ill children and their families.

      "description": "Sen. John Fetterman (D-Penn.) on Monday said he sent \"ethically challenged\" Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) a Cameo video from former Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.), who was expelled from Congress last week.",
      "content": "( The Hill ) – Sen. John Fetterman (D-Penn.) on Monday said he sent “ethically challenged” Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) a Cameo video from former Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.), who was expelled from Congress last week. “I thought my ethically-challenged colleague @BobMenendezNJ could use some encouragement given his substantial legal problems,” Fetterman wrote Monday in a post on X, formerly Twitter. “So, I approached a seasoned expert on the matter to give ‘Bobby from Jersey’ some advice.” Attached to Fetterman’s post was the purported Cameo video from Santos, in which the ousted New York Republican said, “Hey Bobby … look I don’t need to tell you but these people that want to make you get in trouble and want to kick you out and make you run away — You make ’em put up or shut up. You stand your ground, sir.” “And don’t get bogged down by all the haters out there,” Santos continued. “Stay strong. Merry Christmas.” The Hill reached out to Menendez’s office to confirm if the senator received the video. Responding to Fetterman’s post on X, Santos appeared to be unaware of who exactly “Bobby from Jersey,” was, writing on X , “I love this! I wish I knew the Bobby in question! LOL.” Earlier Monday, Santos launched a profile on Cameo, a platform where customers can request holiday messages, a pep talk, roasts and birthday wishes from a wide range of public figures. Santos, who calls himself a “Former congressional ‘Icon'” on his profile , is selling the personal videos for $200 each, an increase from his earlier $150 price tag. Fetterman’s requested Cameo video echoes his past calls for Menendez to resign in the wake of the federal criminal charges against the New Jersey Democrat. Fetterman’s calls were further fueled in light of Santos’s expulsion from Congress. The Pennsylvania Democrat argued the allegations against Menendez are “more sinister” than the charges that Santos faces. Menendez, along with his wife, Nadine, are accused of accepting “hundreds of thousands of dollars” in bribes from three businessmen in New Jersey in exchange for using the senator’s “power and influence” as Senate Foreign Relations Committee chair to benefit both the businessmen and Egyptian government. Federal prosecutors with the Southern District of New York charged Menendez with conspiracy to commit bribery, conspiracy to commit honest services fraud, conspiracy to commit extortion and conspiracy for a public official to act as a foreign agent. He has denied the allegations. “We have a colleague in the Senate that actually does much more sinister and serious kinds of things: Sen. Menendez. He needs to go. And if you are going to expel Santos, how can you allow somebody like Menendez to remain in the Senate?” Fetterman said last week in an interview on ABC’s “The View.” Fetterman argued Santos’s “lies were almost, you know, funny” like he “landed on the moon and that kind of stuff.” Santos faces 23 federal criminal charges. He is accused of misleading donors, misrepresenting finances to the public and government agencies, inflating campaign finance reports and charging donors’ credit cards without authorization. He was expelled from Congress in a 311-114-2 vote last week, after the House Ethics Committee issued a damning report detailing “substantial evidence” against Santos. While Fetterman’s calls for Menendez to resign are similar to the views of several others of the Senate Democratic caucus, few senators besides Fetterman have shown a serious interest in holding a vote to oust the embattled lawmaker. Menendez has rejected his colleagues’ calls to resign ahead of his trial and dismissed the charges as “just allegations.”",
